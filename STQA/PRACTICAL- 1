 Steps to Design Test Cases Using Boundary Value Analysis:

1. **Identify the input domain**: The input values that your system can accept.
   - Example: Input values range from 1 to 100.

2. **Determine boundary values**:
   - For each boundary, include:
     - Lower bound: minimum accepted value (1).
     - Upper bound: maximum accepted value (100).
   - Also include values just outside the boundaries:
     - Lower bound - 1 (0).
     - Upper bound + 1 (101).

3. **Create test cases**:
   - You would test the following boundary values:
     - Minimum boundary value (1).
     - Just below the minimum boundary value (0).
     - Just above the minimum boundary value (2).
     - Maximum boundary value (100).
     - Just below the maximum boundary value (99).
     - Just above the maximum boundary value (101).

### Test Case Example for a System with Input Range [1, 100]:

| Test Case ID | Input | Expected Output |
|--------------|-------|-----------------|
| TC001        | 0     | Invalid Input (out of range) |
| TC002        | 1     | Valid Input (lower boundary) |
| TC003        | 2     | Valid Input |
| TC004        | 99    | Valid Input |
| TC005        | 100   | Valid Input (upper boundary) |
| TC006        | 101   | Invalid Input (out of range) |

### Key Points:
- Boundary values are critical as they are most likely to uncover defects.
- You test just below and just above the boundary in addition to the boundary itself.

This technique helps in reducing the number of test cases while still providing a high chance of finding bugs.
