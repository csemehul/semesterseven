To design independent paths by calculating cyclomatic complexity for a "Date Problem" scenario, we first need to understand cyclomatic complexity and how it relates to path testing.

 Cyclomatic Complexity:
Cyclomatic complexity is a software metric that helps determine the number of independent paths through a program. It is calculated from the control flow graph of the program and is defined as:

[ V(G) = E - N + 2P ]

Where:
- ( E ) = Number of edges in the control flow graph
- ( N ) = Number of nodes in the control flow graph
- ( P ) = Number of connected components (usually 1 for a single program)

Alternatively, cyclomatic complexity can be calculated as the number of decision points plus 1.

 The "Date Problem" Example:
Let’s assume we are working on a program that checks if a given date is valid, considering the month, day, and leap year conditions. The date validation logic will include:
1. Checking if the month is valid (1-12).
2. Checking if the day is valid depending on the month (e.g., February should have 28 or 29 days depending on whether it’s a leap year).
3. Checking leap year conditions.

 Control Flow Description:
1. Check if the month is between 1 and 12.
2. Check if the day is valid for the given month.
   - For February: Check if the year is a leap year.
   - For months with 30 days (April, June, September, November).
   - For months with 31 days (January, March, May, etc.).
3. Return valid or invalid based on the checks.

 Control Flow Graph:
- Nodes represent decision points or operations.
- Edges represent transitions between those decisions.

For simplicity, here's a breakdown of the key decisions:

1. Check if the month is between 1 and 12 (decision 1).
2. If month = 2 (February), check for leap year (decision 2).
3. If leap year, check if the day is between 1 and 29; otherwise, between 1 and 28 (decision 3).
4. If month is April, June, September, November, check if day is between 1 and 30 (decision 4).
5. For other months, check if day is between 1 and 31 (decision 5).

 Control Flow Graph Example:
```
(1) ----> [Check month] -----> (2)
       |         |      
       v         v
 [Invalid]    [Valid Month]-----> (3) [Feb check] ---> (4) [Leap Year?]--->(5) [Day Check]
                                            |
                                        [Leap year] --->(6)
                                         (valid/invalid)
```

 Cyclomatic Complexity Calculation:
Using the formula:

1. Number of nodes (N): Total decision nodes (e.g., check month, check day, check leap year).
   - In this case, let’s say there are 6 decision points.
   
2. Number of edges (E): Connections between nodes.
   - Let’s assume 7 edges (as depicted in the graph above).

So, cyclomatic complexity ( V(G) = E - N + 2 ):
[ V(G) = 7 - 6 + 2 = 3 ]

Thus, the cyclomatic complexity is 3, which indicates that there are 3 independent paths through the program.

 Designing Independent Paths:
The number of independent paths corresponds to the cyclomatic complexity. Let’s now describe these paths:

1. Path 1 (Valid Date - Non-leap year, February):
   - Check month (Valid: February)
   - Check leap year (Non-leap year)
   - Check if day is valid (Day ≤ 28)

2. Path 2 (Valid Date - Leap year, February):
   - Check month (Valid: February)
   - Check leap year (Leap year)
   - Check if day is valid (Day ≤ 29)

3. Path 3 (Valid Date - Other months):
   - Check month (Valid: Not February)
   - Check if day is valid depending on the month (31 days for Jan, Mar, etc., 30 days for Apr, Jun, etc.)

 Test Cases for Each Path:

| Test Case ID | Path | Input (Month, Day, Year) | Expected Output |
|--------------|------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| TC001        | Path 1 | (2, 28, 2023)            | Valid Date (Non-leap year) |
| TC002        | Path 2 | (2, 29, 2024)            | Valid Date (Leap year) |
| TC003        | Path 3 | (4, 30, 2023)            | Valid Date (April 30 days) |
| TC004        | Path 3 | (3, 31, 2023)            | Valid Date (March 31 days) |
| TC005        | Path 1 | (2, 30, 2023)            | Invalid Date (Non-leap year) |
| TC006        | Path 2 | (2, 30, 2024)            | Invalid Date (Leap year) |

 Conclusion:
- Cyclomatic complexity helps identify the number of independent paths, which is essential for thorough testing.
- For this "Date Problem," the cyclomatic complexity is 3, so you need at least 3 test cases to cover all independent paths.
