A Decision Table is a black-box test design technique that deals with combinations of inputs to describe the logic of a system. It helps in covering all possible conditions by creating a table of all combinations of inputs and their corresponding actions.

 Example:
Letâ€™s consider a simple example where we validate a login system. The system takes the following inputs:
1. Username (Valid/Invalid)
2. Password (Valid/Invalid)
3. Captcha (Valid/Invalid)

The outcome will be:
- Allow login if all inputs are valid.
- Deny login if any of the inputs are invalid.

 Steps to Create a Decision Table:

1. Identify the conditions:
   - Username (Valid or Invalid)
   - Password (Valid or Invalid)
   - Captcha (Valid or Invalid)

2. Identify the possible actions:
   - Login Allowed
   - Login Denied

3. Create a decision table:
   List all possible combinations of the conditions and the corresponding actions.

 Decision Table for the Login System:

| Test Case ID | Username | Password | Captcha | Expected Action |
|--------------|----------|----------|---------|-----------------|
| TC001        | Valid    | Valid    | Valid   | Login Allowed   |
| TC002        | Valid    | Valid    | Invalid | Login Denied    |
| TC003        | Valid    | Invalid  | Valid   | Login Denied    |
| TC004        | Valid    | Invalid  | Invalid | Login Denied    |
| TC005        | Invalid  | Valid    | Valid   | Login Denied    |
| TC006        | Invalid  | Valid    | Invalid | Login Denied    |
| TC007        | Invalid  | Invalid  | Valid   | Login Denied    |
| TC008        | Invalid  | Invalid  | Invalid | Login Denied    |

 Test Cases Description:

- TC001: All inputs are valid (Username, Password, Captcha). Login is allowed.
- TC002: Captcha is invalid, so even though the Username and Password are valid, Login is denied.
- TC003: Password is invalid, so Login is denied.
- TC004: Both Password and Captcha are invalid, Login is denied.
- TC005: Username is invalid, so Login is denied.
- TC006: Username is invalid, and Captcha is invalid, so Login is denied.
- TC007: Both Username and Password are invalid, Login is denied.
- TC008: All inputs are invalid (Username, Password, Captcha), so Login is denied.

 Conclusion:
- The decision table lists all possible combinations of input conditions and their outcomes, ensuring comprehensive test coverage.
- In this case, we have 8 possible combinations of inputs and actions, and each combination corresponds to a unique test case.

This approach helps ensure that no combination of inputs is missed during testing, and it simplifies the logic for creating comprehensive test cases.
