To design independent paths by taking Decision-to-Decision (DD) paths for the "Date Problem," we first need to understand what DD paths are and how they relate to cyclomatic complexity.

 What is a DD Path?
- A Decision-to-Decision (DD) path is the sequence of instructions from one decision node (a point where the control flow splits) to the next decision node.
- A program is broken down into DD paths for easier path analysis and testing.
- DD paths are often used in conjunction with Basis Path Testing to ensure that all independent paths in the code are tested.

 Example: "Date Problem"
Let’s consider a simple "Date Problem" where we need to check if a given date is valid. The checks include:
1. The month should be between 1 and 12.
2. The day should be valid for the given month.
   - For February, the day should be between 1 and 28 or 29, depending on whether it’s a leap year.
   - For April, June, September, and November, the day should be between 1 and 30.
   - For other months, the day should be between 1 and 31.
3. Check if the year is a leap year.

 Steps for DD Path Analysis:
1. Identify decision points (nodes) in the flowchart of the "Date Problem."
2. Calculate cyclomatic complexity to identify the number of independent paths.
3. List independent paths by examining DD paths between decision points.

 Control Flow Description for the "Date Problem":
1. Check month:
   - Is the month between 1 and 12?
     - Yes → Proceed to check the day.
     - No → Invalid date.
2. Check February (Month 2):
   - Is it February (month = 2)?
     - Yes → Check if it's a leap year.
     - No → Check the day for other months.
3. Check leap year:
   - If the year is divisible by 4 and not by 100, or divisible by 400 → Leap year.
4. Day check for months:
   - For February: Day should be between 1 and 28 (non-leap) or between 1 and 29 (leap year).
   - For months with 30 days (April, June, September, November): Day should be between 1 and 30.
   - For months with 31 days: Day should be between 1 and 31.

 Control Flow Graph for the Date Problem:
- Nodes represent decisions (e.g., checking the month, day, leap year).
- Edges represent transitions between decisions.

 Cyclomatic Complexity Calculation:
- Based on the control flow, cyclomatic complexity (V(G)) is calculated using the formula:
  
  [
  V(G) = E - N + 2
  ]
  Where:
  - ( E ) is the number of edges.
  - ( N ) is the number of nodes.
  
Let’s assume that there are 6 decision points (nodes) and 7 transitions (edges) in the control flow graph. Therefore:

[
V(G) = 7 - 6 + 2 = 3
]

Cyclomatic complexity ( V(G) = 3 ), which means there are 3 independent paths to cover.

 DD Path Design:
Now, we list the independent paths using DD path analysis. These paths will cover all decision-to-decision paths in the control flow.

 Path 1: Valid Date, Non-Leap Year (February)
1. Check if the month is valid (Month = 2).
2. Check if the year is a non-leap year.
3. Check if the day is between 1 and 28 (non-leap year).

 Path 2: Valid Date, Leap Year (February)
1. Check if the month is valid (Month = 2).
2. Check if the year is a leap year.
3. Check if the day is between 1 and 29 (leap year).

 Path 3: Valid Date, Other Months
1. Check if the month is valid (Month ≠ 2).
2. Check if the day is valid for the given month (30 or 31 days).

 Independent DD Paths:

1. Path 1 (February, Non-Leap Year):
   - Month = 2
   - Non-leap year
   - Day between 1 and 28

2. Path 2 (February, Leap Year):
   - Month = 2
   - Leap year
   - Day between 1 and 29

3. Path 3 (Other Months):
   - Month ≠ 2 (e.g., April, June, September, November)
   - Day between 1 and 30 or 31

 Test Case Design:

| Test Case ID | Path  | Month | Day | Year  | Expected Output      |
|--------------|-------|-------|-----|-------|----------------------|
| TC001        | Path 1 | 2     | 28  | 2023  | Valid (Non-leap year) |
| TC002        | Path 2 | 2     | 29  | 2024  | Valid (Leap year)     |
| TC003        | Path 3 | 4     | 30  | 2023  | Valid (April 30 days) |
| TC004        | Path 3 | 3     | 31  | 2023  | Valid (March 31 days) |
| TC005        | Path 1 | 2     | 30  | 2023  | Invalid Date (Non-leap year) |
| TC006        | Path 2 | 2     | 30  | 2024  | Invalid Date (Leap year) |

 Conclusion:
- The Decision-to-Decision (DD) paths identify all independent paths through the decision nodes of the program.
- Cyclomatic complexity helps ensure that all independent paths are covered in testing.
- In the case of the "Date Problem," three independent paths ensure that all valid and invalid date scenarios are tested.
